# Micropulease

[Micropul](https://boardgamegeek.com/boardgame/10660) for Android; play hot-seat or against a bot.

**The existing bots are really bad,** but it's intended to be easy to add your own bot; see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).

Same goes for the renderers which draw the board & tiles.

For notes on checking this out & building it, see [CONTRIBUTING](CONTRIBUTING.md).
